
This is an initial work for the project (E-Workout), which is an application for tracking your workout progress and contacting with trainers for assistance.

This work is built from scratch because after converting the interface into code, we found that the code was not understandable, and we faced difficulty in modifying it.
Therefore, we divided the project into small features and worked on them.


The list of features that we implemented:

1-Creating Pre-built workout scheduels and allowing the user to create scheduels (5/3/2024) // In progress
Note: This feature is incomplete because at that time the project was not connected to a database.


2-Linking the project to Firebase (20/3/2024) // done 
Note: It took us a long time to link because downloading the filter was incorrect, so we faced many problems.

3-Creating a login page (1/4/2024) // done

4-Creating a logout page (1/4/2024) // done

5-Creating a registration page (2/4/2024) // done

6-Creating a Bottom navigation bar and linking all features in one project (22/4/2024) // done 
Note: The first feature was in a separate file.



At the moment, there are no problems and we will try to connect the first feature with Firebase.
And, Making a profile page.
